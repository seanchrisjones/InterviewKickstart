 QUEUES
 
 Queus are a first in first out Data Structure (FIFO)
 -Queues operate by removal in the front / Insertion in the back.
 
 There are aa few implementations of the linked list data structure but the ones with the best time  complexity are the DoublyLinkedList Implementation and The ring buffer.
 - The Ring buffer can run out of space so sometimes the enqueue operation can  fail if there isnt space.
 
 
Queue Operations:
 
 Enqueue()
 Dequeue()
 isEmpty
 peel
