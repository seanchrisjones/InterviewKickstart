/*
 ARRAY
 An array is the general purpose, generic container for storing an ordered collection of elements
 - An array is a SEQUENCE: meaning  you can iterate throught it atleast once
 - COLLECTION: it can be traversed multiple times non destructively and can be accessed using a subscript operator
 - RandomAccessCollection: makes guarantees about efficency
 - Generic Collection: can work with any type
 
 Elements in an array are explicitly ordered
 Random access is a trait that data structures claim if they can handle element retrieval in a constant amount of time .
